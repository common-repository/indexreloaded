*** WordPress Plugin IndexReloaded Changelog ***

2024.10.01 - version 1.2.1
* Fix	- Possible error in indexreloaded-frontend.php, because WordPress-backend-function is_plugin_active() is not present, is fixed
* Fix   - Minor CSS improvement in backend (Show Settings button) 

2024.09.30 - version 1.2.0
* New	- Compatibility with Page Cache-Plugins WP Fastest Cache, W3 Total Cache, Super Page Cache, Rapid Cache, Hummingbird, WP Optimize, Hyper Cache, SpeedyCache, 
          Comet Cache, Cache Enabler, Borlabs Cache, Cachify, Swift Performance Lite, LiteSpeed Cache and WP Super Cache. 
          The compatibility concerns: CCSS to be delivered on 2nd page call, serving fresh pages after ajax-requests, serving fresh page after calling it using URL-paramenter "?forceNewFiles=1",
          for these reasons individual page cache files need to be removed. After file deletion in backend, the entire page cache is purged.
* Fix   - Host external CSS and JS locally: External font-files in CSS get hosted locally as well.
* Tweak - Keep time for generated CSS, JS and external files has new default value 0 (no automatic deletion after specified time in days).
* Fix	- Checking if file exists before unlinking in backend

2024.08.30 - version 1.1.1
* Fix   - "Deactivate on pages" accepts partitial page-URLs (URL must contain 3 or more slashes)
* Fix   - Host external CSS and JS locally: External files from maps.gooleapi.com won't be saved locally, because they don't work
* Fix   - external CSS and JS, if added to the excludes list, will be ignored
* Fix   - CCSS: Selector extraction improved, support for another kind of bracket-expression, added enhanced support for more complicated where-not contstructs

2024.07.21 - version 1.1.0
* New   - Host external CSS and JS locally, it can be enabled or disabled in Backend -> Settings -> Rules for CSS and JS processing.
		  See if any external files got locally hosted in Overview-panel under Files
* New   - Automatic preloads for generated css, js and jquery
* Tweak - List of recommended plugin-excludes reduced
* Tweak - Exclusion of Inline-JS happens automatically only if reference to a "nonce" is contained and detected, CDATA is not a filter no more
* Fix   - Processing now includes inline-scripts, found directly after calls to externally hosted scripts, properly
* Fix   - Processing for CCSS now includes inline-scripts with type="text/html" in models HTML-base, before only scripts with type="text/template" got included
* New   - When JS defering is active, then inline-JS transforms to defered JS as well. Inline-code will be base64-encoded and loaded as src="data:text/javascript;base64,... 
          Note that servers having the "Header set Content-Security-Policy"-directive set up in Apache-configuration need to add to "script-src" data for data, like "data: data;"
* New   - In backend a new button "reveal cached pages" has been added. It includes removal for individual cache-entries.
* New   - In settings we added a link back to overview in region of top of page.
* New   - Processing for CCSS retriggers model creation if size of html to be processed exceeds former size by more than 40 Bytes. 
          This addresses the "Empty cart CCSS"-issue, where CCSS created for the empty cart-page is not covering the needs of the cart-page with products.

2024.06.14 - version 1.0.2
* New   - CSS inside <noscript>-tags is not processed anymore
* New   - Objectcache is deleted for IndexReloaded after customizing the theme
* Tweak - Preloads of font-file will only load, if the referenced filename is present in pagesource, however this requires critical CSS to be set inline to the page
* Fix   - Support for external JS-files - without .js-fileextention - that are loaded using CGI-call to server
* Fix   - Critical fonts processing in CCSS-creation, missing font-weight 700, when only implied by strong, h1 or h2-tags, is fixed
* Fix	- Selector :checked not in CCSS, when critical

2024.05.15 - version 1.0.1
* Fix	- Possible error in indexreloaded.php, because WordPress-backend-function is_plugin_active() is not present, is fixed
* Fix   - Added difference in classes (model from server versus model from client) to valid client-model 
* New   - Added critical fonts processing in CCSS-creation
* Tweak - Added JS-file parameters to grouped extracted JS as variables (with value)
* Tweak - Preloads of images, CSS- or JS-file will only load, if the referenced filename is present in pagesource
* Fix   - CCSS processing of selectors having multiple tilde (~), plus (1) oder '>'s now translate to check selector sequence with correct element indexes

2024.04.04 - version 1.0.0
* Fix - Exclude 404-pages from processing
* New - Tested and works with WordPress 6.5
* New - Information on cache usage and possibility to delete cache (button) in Backend->IndexReloaded->Overview

* New - Version ready for release over wordpress.org - heading for the review :-)
* New - Automatic fix for images without width/height set

2024.03.15 - version 1.0.0 Beta 15032024-1
* Fix - Selectors like #someid > div > div + div (multiple same tags and >, ~ or + betwen them) did go into CSS below due to insufficient logics in code. This has been enhanced and the error is fixed

2024.03.12 - version 1.0.0 Beta 12032024-1
* Fix - PHP_Codesniffer using Wordpress 3.0.1: All errors and warnings fixed, see https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards
* New - Added userrole-md5 to CCSS-model, enabling possible different HTML to be processed correctly when users are logged in

* New - Added code for uninstallation of the plugin
* Fix - Eliminated Server-error 500 on notices dismissal

2024.02.27 - version 1.0.0 Beta 27022024-1
* Fix - Set required PHP-Version from 8.0 to 7.0 again. However a note will display in Backend, if you use PHP lower than 8.0
* New - Option "Defer remaining JS after processing", when processing JS, the remaining JS in HTML will be deferred (only links to files)
		So with this remaining remaining "Eliminate render-blocking resources" penalty points for JS on PageSpeed View disappear
		Now if you "refuse" to identify JS that must not be grouped, because of JS-errors you might encounter, 
		you can try use '.js,-js' in option "Exclude list" (which excludes probably every JS from getting regrouped) and then defer it.
		But be aware that it might look better on PageSpeed then, but with the complete grouping it would still look a lot better.
* Fix - Exclusion for "type=text/html" and "type=text/template" scripts needed some improvement to reach needed precision
* Fix - Notices in the backend on WordPress- or PHP-version are now dismissable

2024.02.20 - version 1.0.0 Beta 20022024-1
* New - Added (important) ajax backpost of rendered final html to server - it then serves from redis into the model-creation-process for CCSS-creation. 
		Redis cached objects have a 24 hours cache-time and get removed by option-save, post-save or plugin-install
* Fix - Another and hopefully last selector dropping during extract unsupported CSS fixed
